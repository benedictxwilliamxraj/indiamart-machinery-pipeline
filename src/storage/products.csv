Nip section is open close with the help of Pneumatic controller. From Nip section to Winder unit film will move down and goes to Winding section. User can adjust the tube size as per requirement.     In typical parlance, the word biodegradable is distinct in meaning from compostable. While biodegradable simply means an object is capable of being decomposed by bacteria or other living organisms, ""compostable"" in the plastic industry is defined as able to decompose in aerobic environments that are maintained under specific controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Compostable means capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials.     Most bags that are manufactured from plastic are made from corn-based materials, like polylactic acid blends. Biodegradable plastic bags are nowadays as strong and reliable as traditional (mostly polyethylene)-bags. Many bags are also made from paper, organic materials, or polycaprolactone.",https://export.indiamart.com/company/ocean-extrutech/,,,,,,,[],[]

It causes 100% rotary motion and causes dispersion stirring & stratification of material to be sifted. Feed material constantly flows in Horizontal motion along a loop pattern on Vibro screen surface.""PIVT"" vibro screen provides optimum screening & assures maximum feed-rate & efficiency.  FEATURES Gyro screen are driven by a special type of vertically mounted motor having eccentric at the upper & lower end of the shaft. Rotation of out of balance top weight causes vibration in Horizontal plane whereas the rotation of lower weight causes tilt & vibrations in vertical plane.  PRINCIPLES OF MULTIPLANE MOTION The heart of the Gyro screen is its special heavy duty, Robust Motor, having out of balance weight at top & bottom. By changing their lead angle, various spiral-screening patterns are obtained to suit different application.

Sealers are available in two models as per the application requirement i.e. Impulse sealer or Hot Bar sealer. A simple assembly consists of one static and one movable jaw and a control panel for setting up of the desired temperature as per the material and thickness of the pouches. A prefilled pouch is placed between the jaw and when the foot switch is pressed, the movable jaw will be pressed on the static jaw with high pressure. A current is passed through the filament generating the heat which will slightly melt the pouch and seals the bag. Hot bar models are available where the requirement for pressure and the sealing width is high. Various sealing types such as double line, zigzag etc. can be provided as per the requirement.    Specifications:  Impulse sealing and Hot bar Models. Material :HDPE, Plastic, Aluminum foil, BOPP, PP,. Sealing width: 8mm. Sealing Pattern : Diamond/Lines.

Plastic film washing lines are an integral part of the plastic film recycling process. A plastic film washing line consists of a set of washing equipment that uses friction and high speeds to throughly wash dirty or soiled plastic films, such as LDPE film, into clean films suitable for pelletizing, the process of melting plastic into plastic granules, or reprocessed plastic pellets. These plastic pellets can then be used as raw materials for manufacturing new products.  Generally speaking, a plastic film washing line is composed of several pieces of core equipment that include a shredder or granulator, high-speed friction washer, a gravity “sink/float” separation tank, and a dewatering / drying system. The material moves from one machine to another using belt/screw conveyors and or vacuum hosing. Although washing equipment comes in various models, some with innovative designs and technology, the general concept of each equipment remains the same. Additional machinery such as rotating trommels, air classifiers, or bouncing conveyors/tables can be added to remove specific contaminants and improving the overall quality/cleanliness of the washed films.",https://export.indiamart.com/company/ocean-extrutech/,,,,,,,[],[]

These pads are designed to provide comfort and hygiene by absorbing liquids and preventing leaks, making them essential in healthcare, elderly care, and medical settings.  Key Features and Components of an Adult Underpad Making Machine:  Raw Material Feeding:  The machine begins by feeding in nonwoven fabrics, absorbent core materials (usually a combination of fluff pulp and superabsorbent polymers), and other components (such as backsheet materials). The fabrics are unwound from large rolls and moved into the machine for further processing.  Absorbent Core Formation:  The absorbent core is the central component of an underpad. In some machines, a fluff pulp is combined with superabsorbent polymers and adhesive to form the core. The core is then placed between layers of nonwoven fabric to enhance liquid retention.  Layering and Laminating:  The machine lays out multiple layers of nonwoven fabric, including an upper layer (which touches the skin), the absorbent core (for fluid absorption), and a backsheet layer (typically a waterproof or liquid-resistant layer to prevent leakage). The adhesive bonding or ultrasonic welding is used to laminate these layers together securely.  Edge Sealing:  The edges of the underpad are sealed to ensure that the layers stay intact. This is typically done through heat sealing or ultrasonic bonding, which ensures that the underpad has a consistent, leak-proof seal around the edges.  Cutting and Shaping:  Once the layers are bonded together, the machine cuts the underpad into its final shape and size, which is typically rectangular or square but can be customized. The cutting system is precise to ensure consistent dimensions for each underpad.  Perforation and Folding:  Some machines incorporate a perforation system to make it easier to fold or separate the pads later on. These perforations ensure easy handling and packing of individual pads.  Quality Control:  The machine is typically equipped with automatic detection sensors to ensure proper quality control, such as ensuring the right amount of absorbent material, the correct alignment of layers, and proper bonding. Visual inspection or other automated systems may also check for defects like misaligned layers or poor sealing.  Packaging:  After the underpads are cut and inspected, they are automatically stacked, counted, and packed into individual bags or boxes for shipment. Some machines may also include a folding mechanism to fold the underpads into compact sizes for easy packaging.",https://export.indiamart.com/company/amarnaathhenterprises/,,,,,,,[],[]
