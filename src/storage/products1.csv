The blown tube will be move up side manually from the Die to Nip Unit via Basket. Basket size is adjustable as per Tube Dia. Nip is driven by Motor Drive and Gear Box. Nip section is open close with the help of Pneumatic controller. From Nip section to Winder unit film will move down and goes to Winding section. User can adjust the tube size as per requirement.     In typical parlance, the word biodegradable is distinct in meaning from compostable. While biodegradable simply means an object is capable of being decomposed by bacteria or other living organisms, ""compostable"" in the plastic industry is defined as able to decompose in aerobic environments that are maintained under specific controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Compostable means capable of undergoing biological decomposition in a compost site such that the material is not visually distinguishable and breaks down into carbon dioxide, water, inorganic compounds and biomass at a rate consistent with known compostable materials.     Most bags that are manufactured from plastic are made from corn-based materials, like polylactic acid blends. Biodegradable plastic bags are nowadays as strong and reliable as traditional (mostly polyethylene)-bags. Many bags are also made from paper, organic materials, or polycaprolactone.",,https://export.indiamart.com/company/ocean-extrutech/,,,,,,[],[]

It causes 100% rotary motion and causes dispersion stirring & stratification of material to be sifted. Feed material constantly flows in Horizontal motion along a loop pattern on Vibro screen surface.""PIVT"" vibro screen provides optimum screening & assures maximum feed-rate & efficiency.  FEATURES Gyro screen are driven by a special type of vertically mounted motor having eccentric at the upper & lower end of the shaft. Rotation of out of balance top weight causes vibration in Horizontal plane whereas the rotation of lower weight causes tilt & vibrations in vertical plane.  PRINCIPLES OF MULTIPLANE MOTION The heart of the Gyro screen is its special heavy duty, Robust Motor, having out of balance weight at top & bottom. By changing their lead angle, various spiral-screening patterns are obtained to suit different application.

Sealers are available in two models as per the application requirement i.e. Impulse sealer or Hot Bar sealer. A simple assembly consists of one static and one movable jaw and a control panel for setting up of the desired temperature as per the material and thickness of the pouches. A prefilled pouch is placed between the jaw and when the foot switch is pressed, the movable jaw will be pressed on the static jaw with high pressure. A current is passed through the filament generating the heat which will slightly melt the pouch and seals the bag. Hot bar models are available where the requirement for pressure and the sealing width is high. Various sealing types such as double line, zigzag etc. can be provided as per the requirement.    Specifications:  Impulse sealing and Hot bar Models. Material :HDPE, Plastic, Aluminum foil, BOPP, PP,. Sealing width: 8mm. Sealing Pattern : Diamond/Lines.

This system is specifically designed for batch processing of film waste materials, offering a fully automated solution.   The process flow is as follows:   Conveyor Belt: The film-grade material is directly loaded onto the conveyor belt. Cutting Unit: The material is then fed into the cutting unit, where it is pre-processed. Washing Unit: The material is washed using a combination of Caustic Soda and Clean Water, effectively removing contaminants. Drying Unit: Finally, the washed material enters the drying unit, where it is processed to remove excess moisture.   The finished product is in flakes/chips form, with cleanliness levels of 95% to 98% and moisture content reduced to 80% to 90%.   Key Features:  High Cleaning Efficiency: Achieves superior cleaning results, with up to 98% of contaminants removed. Durable Construction: The washing line features SS (stainless steel) for all water-contacting parts, ensuring longevity and resistance to corrosion, while the MS (mild steel) structure provides structural integrity. Automatic System: Streamlines the entire washing process, reducing labor and improving productivity.

Where raw material washed in vertically designed tank. After first wash, raw material conveyed to next washing tank which is horizontally designed. It contains several rotors to lead raw material forward. Main application of horizontal tank is to collect heavy durt at the floor of washing tank and then its conveyed out of the process with screw conveyor fitted inside the tank. Washed material then dropped into the dryer machine which dries the material completely.  Suitability :  Automatic washing line is mostly suggested for article plastic.

Here's a general outline for a rotomolding lab equipment specification:    Material Selection:  Specify the type of plastic material required for the rotomolded equipment. Common materials include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), or specialty polymers for chemical resistance. Specify any additives needed for UV stabilization, flame retardancy, or chemical resistance, depending on the intended use of the equipment.  Design Requirements:  Detail the dimensions and capacity requirements for the equipment, ensuring it fits the intended laboratory space and can accommodate the necessary volume of materials. Specify any structural reinforcements needed for load-bearing components or areas subject to mechanical stress. Define any special features required, such as integrated fittings, ports, or access points for connecting to other equipment or systems.  Performance Standards:  Define performance criteria such as durability, chemical resistance, temperature stability, and cleanliness requirements. Specify any regulatory standards the equipment must meet, such as FDA regulations for food contact materials or ASTM standards for chemical resistance.  Surface Finish and Cleanability:  Specify the required surface finish for the equipment, considering factors such as ease of cleaning, resistance to staining, and compatibility with disinfection procedures. Define any specific cleaning protocols or agents that the equipment must withstand without degradation.  Safety Features:  Outline any safety features required for the equipment, such as tamper-resistant closures, ergonomic handles, or spill containment features. Specify any requirements for labeling or marking to indicate potential hazards or usage instructions.  Quality Assurance:  Define quality control measures for the manufacturing process, such as inspection procedures, testing protocols, and documentation requirements. Specify any warranty or guarantee requirements for the equipment's performance and durability.  Environmental Considerations:  Specify any environmental sustainability requirements, such as using recycled materials, minimizing waste during production, or ensuring recyclability at the end of the equipment's life cycle.",,https://export.indiamart.com/company/micromatic-technologies/,,,,,,[],[]
